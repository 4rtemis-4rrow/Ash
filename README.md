# Ash
Ash (pronounced as the word ash, short for arrow shell) is a simple lightweight linux shell written in C

I wrote this for the sake of practice, I don't recommend using it, though it is reliable, maybe if you are looking for something super light weight, go for it, besides that, just use zsh, zsh is great
